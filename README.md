## üìñ Overview

This is home to my personal Kubernetes lab cluster. [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches this Git repository
and makes the changes to my cluster based on the manifests in the [kubernetes](./kubernetes/)
directory. [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) also watches this Git repository and creates pull
requests when it finds updates to Docker images, Helm charts, and other dependencies.

## ‚õµ Kubernetes

I used the [onedr0p/flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template) as a starting point for my
cluster.

### Installation

My cluster is [k3s](https://k3s.io/) provisioned overtop Ubuntu Proxmox VMs using
the [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) galaxy role [ansible-role-k3s](https://github.com/PyratLabs/ansible-role-k3s).
This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a
separate VM running TrueNAS Scale for data storage.

üî∏ [Click here](./ansible) to see my Ansible playbooks and roles._

### Core Components

- [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.io/): Announces the kubeserver api via BGP
- [metallb](https://metallb.universe.tf/): Announces loadbalancers via BGP
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): Creates SSL certificates for services in my Kubernetes cluster
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): Automatically manages DNS records from my cluster in
  a cloud DNS provider
- [k8s-gateway](https://gateway-api.sigs.k8s.io/): Runs a separate internal-only DNS zone for some services
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): Ingress controller to expose HTTP traffic to pods over
  DNS
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): Managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible and Terraform which
  are commited to Git
- [cilium](https://cilium.io/): Provides networking, security, and observability
- [rook-ceph](https://rook.io/): Provides block, object, and file storage

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches my [kubernetes](./kubernetes) folder (see Directories below) and makes
the changes to my cluster based on the YAML manifests.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates,
when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2)
applies the changes to my cluster.
